-- ================================================================
-- FIX THE ENTIRE DATA PIPELINE
-- Complete re-architecture to make data actually flow
-- ================================================================

-- Step 1: ACTUALLY clear all data (the clean script isn't working)
TRUNCATE TABLE mangalam_invoices, orders, products, stores, call_prioritization CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Create proper indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_customer_name ON mangalam_invoices(customer_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_item_name ON mangalam_invoices(item_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_invoice_date ON mangalam_invoices(invoice_date);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_date_range ON mangalam_invoices(invoice_date DESC);

-- Step 3: Create a proper view that doesn't depend on empty tables
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS dashboard_data CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW dashboard_data AS

  SELECT 
    customer_name as store_name,
    customer_id as store_id,

    MAX(invoice_date) as last_order_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_number) as total_orders,
    SUM(total) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total) as avg_order_value,
    COUNT(DISTINCT item_name) as unique_products,
    SUM(quantity) as total_items_sold

  WHERE customer_name IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY customer_name, customer_id
),
recent_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_name,
    invoice_date,
    invoice_number,
    total,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_name ORDER BY invoice_date DESC) as rn
  FROM mangalam_invoices
  WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT 
  sa.*,
  ro.invoice_number as last_invoice,
  ro.total as last_order_amount,
  CASE 
    WHEN last_order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'Active'
    WHEN last_order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'Regular'
    WHEN last_order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '60 days' THEN 'At Risk'

  EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE - last_order_date) as days_since_last_order
FROM store_aggregates sa
LEFT JOIN recent_orders ro ON sa.store_name = ro.customer_name AND ro.rn = 1;

-- Step 4: Create a trigger to automatically populate normalized tables
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION populate_normalized_tables()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$

      COALESCE(NEW.brand, 'Unknown'),

-- Step 5: Create the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS auto_populate_normalized ON mangalam_invoices;
CREATE TRIGGER auto_populate_normalized
AFTER INSERT ON mangalam_invoices
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION populate_normalized_tables();

-- Step 6: Function to fix date issues - make old data appear current
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_dates_to_current()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  max_date DATE;
  date_offset INTERVAL;
BEGIN
  -- Get the newest date in the data
  SELECT MAX(invoice_date) INTO max_date FROM mangalam_invoices;

  -- Update all dates to be relative to today
  UPDATE mangalam_invoices
  SET invoice_date = invoice_date + date_offset
  WHERE invoice_date IS NOT NULL;
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Updated all dates by % days to make them current', EXTRACT(DAY FROM date_offset);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 7: Create materialized view for performance
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS dashboard_metrics CASCADE;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dashboard_metrics AS
SELECT 
  DATE(invoice_date) as date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_number) as total_orders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_name) as unique_stores,

  COUNT(DISTINCT brand) as brands_sold
FROM mangalam_invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY DATE(invoice_date)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Create index on the materialized view
CREATE INDEX idx_dashboard_metrics_date ON dashboard_metrics(date);

-- Step 8: Function to refresh all materialized views
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_dashboard_data()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY dashboard_metrics;
  RAISE NOTICE 'Dashboard data refreshed successfully';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 9: Create a simple API view that ACTUALLY WORKS
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW api_dashboard_summary AS
SELECT 
  -- Today's metrics
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE DATE(invoice_date) = CURRENT_DATE) as orders_today,
  (SELECT SUM(total) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE DATE(invoice_date) = CURRENT_DATE) as revenue_today,
  
  -- This week's metrics  
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days') as orders_week,
  (SELECT SUM(total) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days') as revenue_week,
  
  -- This month's metrics
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days') as orders_month,
  (SELECT SUM(total) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days') as revenue_month,
  
  -- Store metrics
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_name) FROM mangalam_invoices) as total_stores,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_name) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE invoice_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days') as active_stores,
  
  -- Product metrics
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT item_name) FROM mangalam_invoices) as total_products,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT brand) FROM mangalam_invoices WHERE brand IS NOT NULL) as total_brands;

-- Step 10: Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO mangalm;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO mangalm;
GRANT ALL ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO mangalm;

-- Display current status
