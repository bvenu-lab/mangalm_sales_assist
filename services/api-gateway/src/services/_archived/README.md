## ml-analytics-service.ts

**Date Archived:** 2025-09-12
**Reason:** Redundant implementation

This ML analytics service was created as a redundant implementation when sophisticated ML algorithms already existed in the `ai-prediction-service` codebase. 

The existing implementation in `services/ai-prediction-service/src/ml/enterprise-ml-engine.ts` already contains:
- ARIMA (time series forecasting)
- LSTM (deep learning)
- XGBoost (gradient boosting)
- Random Forest
- K-Means clustering
- DBSCAN (density-based clustering)
- Prophet (Facebook's forecasting)
- And many more sophisticated algorithms

The existing ML code has TypeScript compilation errors that need to be fixed, but the algorithms themselves are already well-implemented and don't require external API calls to OpenAI/Claude.

**TODO:** Fix the TypeScript compilation errors in the existing ML implementation rather than creating new redundant implementations.
