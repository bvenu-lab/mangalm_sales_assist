# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).

# server.js serves the React app
# package files are needed for dependencies
# Procfile tells Cloud Run how to start the app
