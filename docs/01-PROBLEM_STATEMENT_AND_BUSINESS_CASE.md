## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in FMCG Distribution

#### 1. Inefficient Sales Operations
- **Manual Route Planning**: Sales representatives waste 30-40% of their time on non-productive activities
- **Reactive Approach**: Orders are placed only when stores run out of stock, leading to lost sales
- **Poor Time Management**: Equal time spent on all stores regardless of potential value
- **Missed Opportunities**: 60% of potential upselling opportunities go unidentified

#### 2. Inventory Management Issues
- **Stock-outs**: 15-20% of stores experience regular stock-outs
- **Overstocking**: 25% of products expire or become obsolete due to poor demand forecasting
- **Cash Flow Problems**: Irregular ordering patterns create unpredictable cash flows
- **Supply Chain Inefficiencies**: Reactive ordering leads to rushed deliveries and higher logistics costs

#### 3. Customer Relationship Challenges
- **Inconsistent Service**: Store owners receive irregular visits from sales representatives
- **Lack of Personalization**: Generic product recommendations ignore store-specific patterns
- **Poor Communication**: No systematic tracking of store preferences and feedback
- **Competitive Threats**: Competitors with better service capture market share

#### 4. Data Utilization Gap
- **Siloed Information**: Sales, inventory, and customer data exist in disconnected systems
- **No Predictive Capabilities**: Historical data unused for future planning
- **Manual Reporting**: Hours spent creating reports that provide limited actionable insights
- **Decision Paralysis**: Too much raw data, too little intelligence
