# User Journey: AI-Native for Rapid Solution Generation

**Scenario:** Small business owner or nontechnical company wants customized software solution but can't afford the cost 
or time investment of the existing large solution just wants a solution that does what they need, the way they need it, 
and with none of the extra fluff or costs. Wants an easy to use interface with minimal questions to define the product/solution
that they want, the interface, I/O, pain-points, product-requirements, etc.

## Overview
The high level overview of the user journey is that the user will answer a few questions presented by the AI-agent about the solution 
they want to create, it will start to create the contextual docs for it, then ask clarifying questions along the way and show the design
similar to how an SaaS team would consult with the client to determine their requirements first, then generate an initial design doc, wire frame,
architecture diagrams, and tasks/duration/roadmaps, then iterate with the user until they are satisfied. The AI-Agents, then execute on this, 
present the status to the dashboard/project-manager along the way, create project-status reports and demos for releases for different stages
depending on complexity, the use can provide feedback, make feature requests, shift direction, etc. along the way, with adjustments to the 
timeline/schedule as needed, and with the dashboard/project-manager showing errors/testing/debugging status/progress as well. Our solution
continues to build, test, and iterate with the user as needed until it converges and they are satisfied.  

The user journey is expected to be highly AI driven with the large majority of the context generated by the AI-agents from a few
highly targeted survey questions from the AI with additional contextual docs provided by the user if available to further 
customize/specialize the solution (e.g. screen shots, solution design spec, I/O data examples). The AI-agents then perform
research on the internet (general search and similar products/solutions) to fully characterize and define the product requirements, 
design specs, UI/UX, etc. needed to meet the user's goals given the user's desired solution input and desired output. 
This context is used as the foundation for the code buildings and implementation using a well defined template implementation plan and an
AI-organization to execute on that plan and update the user through the dashboard and project manager. The User interacts with the AI-Project 
manager in the dashboard/front-end which then interactions with the AI-organization who then adjust adapt the implementation plan/status as 
needed and then continue with implementation and execution in the code. A quality assurance ai-agent verifies and checks progress and the outcome 
of each step and verifies that they did what they were supposed to do based on the task/request/next-step and that they remain on task. The QA-agent
also provides course correction to the ai-agents that are doing the execution. The QA agent communicates the status and course-corrections to the
AI-project manager who then shows the details of this to the user in an easy to understand and explainable manner in the dashboard/frontend. The user
can provide feedback at any time through the dashboard/frontend to request feature/capability changes or to let the AI know it's off track. If
a feature/capability request then it would get submitted as something like a ticket and the implementation plan would be updated to include this
in the appropriate phase. The user would be notified that their request has been integrated into the plan and when it will be started and finished.
If the users requests was to course-correct the AI-agents/execution, then it stops the current execution and reassess based on the feedback. 
The dashboard/front-end shows the user the number, distribution, and types of errors and trends in their stats over time as well, where the user can 
also provide feedback on how/when to change strategies for debugging (e.g. take a step back and reassess the errors from a holistic perspective, 
then systematically debug).   

provide detailed instructions on the User, AI-Project Manager-Agent, AI product/Project Team MAS (orchestrator to managage the coding, software,
project/product/quality/management/go-to-market/ci-cd/director-vision/etc. level roles/tasks/responsibilities and coordination), then interactions
of that with the MAS-code layer and all those agents that interact with the portions of the code in the mult-modal data in a distributed external 
memory manner with semantic indexing. this should have a modular agent/node setup that encapsulate the codebase, where the agents communicate through
A2A protocols via context controlles/memory manangers, and gpt modelts are intelligently used with smaller, medium, and large all being used for 
their appropriate tasks based on what they were designed for and are best used for. the solution is expected to be a real e2e prototype with real 
api keys (openai, claude, and local model), using postgresql db and mongodb if needed. The database that is there now already has a complex ai agent
orchestration so this new MAS-code can be added. A compiler, such as powershell needs to be added to run on the backend, and the approproate ai-agents
need to interact with it, and keep track of errors, debug errors efficiently holistically, top-down, and systematically, while the QA agent ensure they
stay on track and are making progress. the errors, their progress also need to be report through the MAS-AI-team to the AI-PM-Agent to the dashboard-webapp
to the user so they know progress is being made. note, all the code can be written/read/modified on the backend and never needs to be presented to the user.
multiple agents should be able to write code in parrall to accelerate the writing/editing/reading process and a smart planner/orchestrator is needed to ensure
that no two agents try to modify the same file at the same time. Efficiency and accuracy are key while also ensuring the accurate, unbiased, and reliable
reporting to the user. so all files/code will be indexed, and portions of files can be read instead of entire files and portions can be updated as enough
attributes will be associated with the files to be able to determine what changes in the index/file are associates with what lines of code. after changes
are updated, the file will be reindexed for rapid queries again. make sure you fully understand this process, fill in all the gaps, and make it flow like
an enterprise level system.
